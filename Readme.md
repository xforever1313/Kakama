# Kakama

Kakama is intended to be an [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) bot framework.  ActivityPub powers [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/), and many other services on the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).

The intent behind this bot is it allows one to self-host an ActivityPub server without the overhead of running a Mastodon instance.  Configuration is meant to be simple.  Kakama is also able to take in plugins to further extend its capabilities.

## Active Development

Kakama is undergoing active development, and is not ready for production.

## Name

The name is inspired from Bionicle's [Mask of Speed](https://bionicle.fandom.com/wiki/Kakama) wore mainly by [Pohatu](https://bionicle.fandom.com/wiki/Pohatu_(2001)).  This project is _not_ associated with or endorsed by Lego in any way, shape, or form.
